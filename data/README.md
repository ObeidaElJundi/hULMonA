# Datasets
To provide credible evaluation for the performance of our ULM, we catalog a benchmark dataset for Arabic which can also be used for future research benchmark evaluations. The data sets vary in size allowing us to demonstrate the ULMâ€™s abilities to fine tune with little data and achieve high performance. The benchmark data set is summarized in the following table:

  **DATASET** | **RESOURCE** | **# SAMPLES** | **# CLASSES** | **MSA \|\| DIALECT**
------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------
HARD | Hotel reviews </br> (www.booking.com) | 93700 | 4 | MSA & Gulf
ASTD | Twitter | 10000 | 4 | MSA & Egyptian
ASTD-B | Twitter | 1600 | 2 | MSA & Egyptian
ArSenTD-Lev | Twitter | 4000 | 5 | Levantine

More details about the aforementioned datasets are found in [the paper.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4608)

In this directory, there are two versions of every dataset:
 1. the original dataset.
 2. the dataset preprocessed using MADAMIRA (with **_final** suffix). This version is used as input to our model.
